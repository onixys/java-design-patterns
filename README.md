# java-design-patterns

* Creational Design Patterns: These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
    * Factory: Define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
    * Abstract Factory:
    * Singleton: Define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    * Prototype
    * Builder
    * Object Pool

* Structural Design Patterns: These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
    * Facade
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Adapter
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy
    * Filter

* Behavioral Design Patterns: These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

* JEE Design Patterns: These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
