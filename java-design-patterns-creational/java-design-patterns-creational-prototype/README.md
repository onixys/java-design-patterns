# Java Design Patterns - Creational

## Prototype

### Problem
you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy of it.
How would you do it? First, you have to create a new object of the same class.
Then you have to go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object.

But not all objects can be copied that way because some of the objectâ€™s fields may be private and not visible from outside of the object itself.

### Solution
The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned. The pattern declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning. This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your code to the class of that object. Usually, such an interface contains just a single clone method.

The implementation of the clone method is very similar in all classes. The method creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field values of the old object into the new one. You can even copy private fields because most programming languages let objects access private fields of other objects that belong to the same class.

An object that supports cloning is called a prototype. When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing.
